# Scrum

## General

Scrum is considered to be a framework that is lightweight and simple to understand, but difficult to master. 

Scrum theory is founded on empirical process control theory, which states that knowledge comes from both experience and making decisions based on possessed knowledge.

Three pillars of Scrum:

Transparency
- Having a shared definition of "Done"
- Sharing a common understanding of vocabulary in the technical space. For example, everyone has a shared understanding of what feature and code freeze mean in the workspace. 

Inspection
- Scrum users should frequently evaluate the components being worked on in our codebase, but not so frequently that it gets in the way of your own work. 

Adaptation
- Four functions in the Scrum framework to perform inspection and adaptation
    - Sprint Planning
    - Daily standup
    - Sprint review
    - Sprint retro

A Scrum team will usually have several Product Owners, a Development Team, and the Scrum Master who oversees the functions of the Scrum framework, such as daily stand-ups, sprint review, retros, etc. 

## The Product Owner

Maximizes the value for the product that they are overseeing. They are responsible for clearly identifying and presenting the items on the backlog for the given product, giving them an order of importance, and ensuring that the development team understand what needs to be worked on in the given order of priority. 

Product owners can do some of the said work, or they can let the Development team focus on it. Either way, they are held accountable. 

## The Development Team

Responsible for working on given tasks from Product owners and ensuring that they reach the agreed upon definition of done.

Dev teams should be small enough to be flexible, but big enough to make impactful changes to the product. 

## Sprint Planning

The work to be performed for the given sprint is defined during the sprint planning, which is a result of the collaboration of the entire team.

## Daily Scrum

15 minute event where you speak to what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today, and if there are any blockers in your work. 

## Sprint Review

This is where the team can showcase what they worked on during the sprint, and talk about any difficulties or progress.

## Sprint Retrospective

Also happens at the end of the sprint before sprint planning for the next sprint. Allows for the discuss what went well during the sprint, what went poorly, and what actionable items can be presented to improve on what went poorly in the next sprint.

# Shape-Up: Show Progress

## Status Tracking Issues

Managers will try their best not to nag developer on progress. They don't want to disrupt their workflow with pointless meetings.

## Incomplete Tasks

A list of tasks that still need to be done may not provide the best image of what the state of the project is at. On the other hand, the list may only have tasks that are complete without showing the full picture of what still needs to be completed. 

## Estimates

Estimates are difficult to do accurately, and may be unreliable when software work can frequently be agile. 

## The Hill Chart

Work can instead be divided into two sections within a hill chart. The uphill portion will represent uncertainty in the project and potential problem-solving for architecture the solution. On the other hand, the downhill will be the portion of the hill chart where execution of the plan is done.

## Scope on the Hill

Scopes are represented by different colour nodes on the chart that provide a visual representation of the progress

## Status without Asking

Rather than having managers nag you for progress, they can reference your progress on the hill chart that you frequently keep up to date

## Uncertainty and Problem Solving

Additionally to providing status updates to managers, it also allows your coworkers to see which tasks you are potentially blocked on

## Prompts to Refactor Scopes

In some cases the scope for a project may be too large. This is where it can be broken down into smaller components which are more manageable 

## Build Your Way Uphill

Do not prematurely move nodes to the top of the hill before they have been fully explored and architected. Validate the progress and that your solution is viable. 

## Solve in the Right Sequence

The hill chart can also provide a guideline on the sequence of tasks that should be completed to ensure no blockers appear due to potential dependencies
