# 1: Introduction

Growing pains
- Projects seem to never end, scope creep
- PM have no time to properly evaluate next steps
- Founders/stakeholders question why we can't get features out the door like we did when we were smaller 

4 -> 40 people

Basecamp: Centralized place where all parties could see the work, converse, and figure out next steps

Difficult to explain to new members of the team what was being done. Hard to convey intuition when everyone is working remotely 

Six-week Cycles. Long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish, and short enough to feel the stress of the deadline quickly approaching. 

No daily meetings, no micromanaging, a simple "If we get this feature shipped in 6 weeks that'd be neat"

Shaping the work before giving it to the dev team. Stakeholders will define key elemenets for a given project. Specific enough so that the teams know what it needs to do, but abstract enough so that the specifics can be done in the way they feel best. 

Appetite: rather than asking how long, we ask how much do we want to spend on this? How much value will this bring?

Making teams responsible: Rather than micromanaging a team, we give them full responsibility and allow them to make modifications to the scope as necessary. Not a simple ticket-taker scenario. 

Largest risk to target: not shipping on time. Risk of blockers, risk of unexpected problems, etc.

Shape: low fidelity prototype, appetite, pitch
Betting: Choose a pitched project to work on 6 weeks at a time
Building: Allow teams explore the solution

# 2: Principles of Shaping

Wireframes are too concrete, we want to aim to strike the right balance between abstract and conrete. A specific pitfall of being too conrete can be providing a high fidelity wireframe/prototype which can hinder the creativity of the team developing the product. The team will focus on developing it the way it was shown in the prototype rather than having the necessary freedom to make it the way that they want, leading to projects taking longer to complete. On the other hand, being overly abstract can lead to teams not knowing exactly what they need to build. 

To strike this perfect balance, two main points are followed: 

shaping involves private meetings between seniors to conceptualize what the project will produce through setting boundaries for scope, estimating high-level elements, addressing potential risks, and finally pitching the problem, constraints, and proposed solution.

building is then done by the team, and is more successful depending on how well the shaping of the project was done.

# 3: Set Boundaries

The initial step in shaping involves setting boundaries for the project; this also includes distinguishing between small improvements and major redesigns. This may require the team to consider what is nice to have, and what is necessary if the scope is too large.

Generally a conversation will be initiated by asking a very high-level question like "How do we use AI to improve our workflow?". This feedback can be used to gauge the "appetite" for a given project to see how much value it may add, and how much time should be allocated to it. The appetite will define whether a small team will spend 1-2 weeks on the project, or if a large team will spend a full six-week cycle on it.

The concept of fixed time, variable scope guides the project by constraining the design process based on the allotted time. It ensures that developers don't stray and complete the necessary tasks for the project.

It is important to respond to new ideas with caution, and evaluate the feasibility of the project and its value. Avoiding immediate commitment to something that may not be useful is key, and keeping options open for potential alternative ways to implement the idea. Rather than focusing in on the proposed idea, make sure to understand it from a high-level to understand basic requirements.

# 4: Find the Elements

Once we are done shaping the project, we begin to focus on conceptualizing ideas to define the key elements of a solution while keeping constraints in mind. We want to evaluate how well the solution fits into the existing system, if it's feasible, and fleshing out use-cases or user stories to fully understand how this will be used.

Breadboarding is a method that involves creating simplified representations of the solution's interface using the flow of phrases. For example, "Turn on AutoPay" leads us to the "Set up Autopay" page if appropriate. This allows the developers to focus on the logic, rather than the visualizations of the task.

Fat marker sketches allow us to create a low fidelity prototype of what our solution will look like. It forces us to avoid detail since the fat marker restricts how much detail we can add to the prototype. The goal is to define clear elements that the solution MUST have, rather than going into the nitty gritty details. 

Elements are the output of these two methodologies. We then shape these elements into more concrete concepts which we can stress-test, and evaluate the risk of. The most important note is that at this point, no commitments or promises have been made. We are still exploring the solution and how we may want to implement it.

# 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes

As our project progresses past the shaping phase, we want to identify and eliminate potential pitfalls in the concept before committing to it. Even the smallest of unexpected problems can result in progress getting blocked, and the project's scope getting derailed. 

To avoid such setbacks, we must thoroughly explore any uncertainties. This includes being unfamiliar with the technology, design challenges, or misunderstandings in the domain or the dependencies of the solution. By addressing these concepts during shaping, we can ensure that our development team does not encounter these road blocks as we have planned for them ahead of time.

Shapers should aim for a thin-tailed probability distribution of risk. This means that the project is well-defined, and the number of unknowns or complexities shrinks as more time is spent on shaping the project. There should be no gaps in knowledge, and the viability of each component for the project should be evaluated. 

With an appropriately shaped project, we can ensure that we don't fall into a rabbit hole. That we don't tunnel vision on completing the task in a specific way which may not be the best, and to re-shape if needed for the specific component. 

It is important to set clear boundaries and declare areas that shouldn't be touched. We want to keep the scope of the project concise and clear, and ensure we are working on aspects that are defined by the appetite. This again boils down to focusing on the must haves, and leaving the unncessary nice to haves for later if time permits.
